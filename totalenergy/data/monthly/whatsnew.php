<p>
1) Total energy consumption (Table 1.2), total energy production (Table 1.3), and electric power sector total primary energy consumption (Table 2.6) no longer include energy consumed by hydroelectric pumped-storage plants. The change was made because most of the electricity used to pump water into elevated storage reservoirs is generated by plants other than pumped-storage plants; thus, the associated energy is already accounted for in other data columns in the tables (such as conventional hydroelectric power, coal, and natural gas). Because the quantities removed were negative values (derived as pumped-storage facility production minus energy used for pumping, where energy used for pumping is usually larger), the overall effect of the change is to raise totals slightly for 1990 forward.

Section 1, Energy Overview:
</p>
<p>
The "Energy Summary" table that previously appeared as Table 1.1 is discontinued.  The remaining tables in the section are renumbered.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 1.1</b>, Energy Overview columns are reordered to show "Production" to "Consumption" (left to right) and to add a column for "Adjustments."  "Net Imports" no longer shows on this table; those data appear on Table 1.4. Consumption data are revised 1985-2002; see Table 1.3 for additional information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 1.2</b>, Energy Production has data revisions, including "Nuclear Electric Power" due to revised heat rates (see Table A6) and "Renewable Energy" (see Section 10).
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 1.3</b>, Energy Consumption is revised due to changes in several components, including:  "Nuclear Electric Power" due to revised heat rates (see Table A6);  "Natural Gas" due to a change in the source for natural gas used by the electric power sector (see Table 4.4); coal (see Table 6.2); and renewable energy (see Table 10.1).  Also, the calculation of electricity net imports, which is a component of total energy consumption, is revised; see Table 1.4 for more information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 1.4</b>, Energy Net Imports includes revised data for electricity. EIA previously estimated the proportions of traded electricity from fossil fuels and hydropower (and applied the fossil-fuel steam-electric-plant heat rate to convert from kilowatthours to Btu) and from geothermal (and applied the heat rate for geothermal energy plants).  EIA no longer has adequate data to estimate the proportions by source and is now applying an overall rate of 3,412 Btu per kilowatthour to all traded electricity.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 1.8</b>, Energy Consumption per Dollar of Gross Domestic Product consumption data are revised; see Table 1.3 for more information.
</p>
<p>
Section 2, Energy Consumption by Sector:
</p>
<p>
Energy consumption data are revised due to changes in several components; see Table 1.3 for more information.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Section 4, Natural Gas:
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 4.1</b>, Natural Gas Overview is redesigned with separate columns for "Imports" and "Exports" (replacing "Net Imports") and separate columns for "Withdrawals From Storage" and "Additions to Storage" (replacing "Net Withdrawals From Storage").  Also, "Consumption" data are revised for 1993 forward; see Table 4.4 and Appendix D for more information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 4.4</b>, Natural Gas Consumption by Sector</li> is redesigned.  Independent power producers' use of natural gas is moved from the industrial sector to a new electric power sector. Data for the new sector are derived from electricity data collection forms, replacing that supplied on natural gas forms.  As a result, total consumption is revised from 1993-2002. Also, data are now shown for industrial sector consumption by combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants and non-CHP plants. For more information, see Appendix D.
</p>
<p>
Section 6, Coal:
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 6.1</b>, Coal Overview is redesigned to replace "Stocks" with "Stock Change" and to add columns for "Waste Coal" and "Losses and Unaccounted for."  Also, "Consumption" data are revised for 1989 forward.  See Appendix D for more information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 6.2</b>, Coal Consumption by Sector</li> is redesigned to show commercial sector and industrial sector combined-heat-and-power plant consumption separately from other consumption in each sector.  For a discussion about these changes and other effects on historical data, see Appendix D. Residential and commercial data are revised due to new methodology---see Note 2 at end of Section 6 for more information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 6.3</b>, Coal Stocks by Sector</li> is redesigned. Coal stocks, which were previously shown separately for "Electric Utilities" and "Other Power Producers," are now shown only combined as "Electric Power Sector."
</p>
<p>
Section 7, Electricity:
</p>
<p>
The electricity section is redesigned to incorporate improved statistics and provide more detailed data. The changes make the <i>Monthly Energy Review (MER)</i> electricity data and the fuel data in other sections of the report consistent, and bring the <i>MER</i> data in line with those in the <i>Annual Energy Review (AER)</i>, which was redesigned in the <i>AER 2001</i> release.  <i>MER</i> tables now show electricity net generation by electric power, commercial, and industrial sectors. Consumption of combustible fuels is also shown by those sectors and further broken down into use for electricity generation only and use for electricity generation and useful thermal output at combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants. For additional discussion of the data changes and their impacts, see Appendix D, "Estimating and Presenting Power Sector Fuel Use in EIA Publications and Analyses."  Tables in the March report are related to those in the April report as follows:

<b>Table 9.10</b>, Cost of Fossil-Fuel Receipts at Electric Generating Plants which previously showed quantity and cost of receipts, now shows cost of receipts only.  Also, "Petroleum Total" and "All Fossil Fuels" averages for 1990-2000 are recalculated to incorporate the cost of petroleum coke, which had not been included previously.  In addition, beginning with the January 2002 data, coverage is expanded from electric utilities only to include independent power producers and electric generating plants in the commercial and industrial sectors as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 9.11</b>, Natural Gas Prices is expanded to include percent-of-sector data, where available, for the residential and electric power sectors.
</p>
<p>
Section 10, Renewable Energy:
</p>
<p>
Data are revised in this section for several reasons, including:
</p>
<p>
<b>Electricity net imports</b> that are derived from hydroelectric power and geothermal energy are no longer included in the renewable energy consumption totals that are shown on Tables 10.1 and 10.2c. Those quantities continue to be included in total U.S. energy consumption as components of electricity net imports, with fuel sources unspecified (see Tables 1.3 and 2.6).  The change results in a 0.1-to-0.5 quadrillion Btu drop in total renewable energy consumption from 1973 forward.
</p>
<p>
<b>Wood</b> and <b>waste</b> energy consumption data for 1989-2002 are revised; biomass data are now developed by aggregating individual power plant data for nonutilities instead of applying a generalized net generation figure.
</p>
<p>
<b>Hydropower</b>, <b>solar</b>, <b>geothermal</b>, and <b>wind</b> energy consumption data for 1989-2002 are revised as a result of a thorough review of historical nonutility electric plant data.
</p>
<p>
Section 11, International Petroleum:
</p>
<p>
<b>Table 11.4a - 11.4e</b>,  "Nuclear Electric Gross Generation," are no longer included in the <i>Monthly Energy Review</i>. Annual data on this topic will continue to appear in the U.S. Energy Information Administration's <i>Annual Energy Review</i>.
</p>
<p>
Appendix A, Thermal Conversion Factors:
</p>
<p>
<b>Table A3-A5</b>, are revised to show heat content averages for the "Electric Power Sector" instead of for "Electric Utilities."  Some other sector averages are recalculated to reflect adjustments in the sector definitions.
</p>
<p>
Appendix D:
</p>
<p>
<b>"Estimating and Presenting Power Sector Fuel Use in EIA Publications and Analyses"</b> is a new, temporary section in the Monthly Energy Review that describes and discusses the changes related to the electricity statistics that are incorporated into this month's release.

Monthly Energy Time Series (METS):  With the August 2000 release of the <i>Monthly Energy Review</i> (MER), the U.S. Energy Information Administration announces a new facility to access long-term monthly time series that parallel the data series routinely released in the MER. Wherever possible, monthly time series from January 1973 forward are now available electronically through METS.
</p>
<p>
To reach the new time series, tap on any energy topic on the MER home page.  METS connections are indicated for any MER data table that has long-term historical monthly data available.
</p>
<p>
METS replaces an EIA product called the <i>Historical Monthly Energy Review</i> (HMER), which was released in paper copy in September 1991 and updated and released again in August 1994.

1)  In the "Energy Summary" section, "Motor Vehicle Mileage, Fuel Consumption, and Fuel Rates" (Table 1.10) expands and replaces "Passenger Car Efficiency."
 In addition to passenger car mileage, fuel consumption, and fuel rates on the old table,  the expanded version provides similar statistics for two additional categories of vehicles---"Vans, Pickup Trucks, and Sport Utility Vehicles" and "Trucks"---and for all vehicles together under "All Motor Vehicles."
</p>
<p>
2)  Nuclear Energy statistics are expanded from 1989 forward to cover all nuclear units in the entire electric power sector, including those that are  nonutility facilities. The additional quantities of electricity net generation are also incorporated into consumption statistics in Overview Tables 1.1 through 1.4 and 1.9 and consumption data in Energy Consumption by Sector.
</p>
<p>
3)  New thermal heat rates for modern motor gasoline that incorporate oxygenated and reformulated gasolines are used to develop petroleum and total energy statistics in British thermal units (Btu).  Annual national consumption-weighted averages of oxygenated, reformulated, and conventional motor gasoline heat rates are applied for all months beginning in 1994, the first year for which consistent data are available.  That is, the motor gasoline factor for converting data from barrels to Btu is no longer a constant value but is now an annual variable based on the quantity of each type of motor gasoline consumed each year. Implementation of the new heat rates impacts all petroleum and total energy consumption, imports, and exports data in Btu from 1994 forward.  See Table A3 for heat rates.

1)  In the "Coal," "Energy Consumption," and "Overview" sections, consumption data are revised to incorporate coal used by "Other Power Producers" into the U.S. energy accounts for 1992 forward. The changes are summarized as follows: Table 6.2 is redesigned to present "End-Use Sectors" and an "Electric Power Sector," which includes "Other Power Producers" for the first time.  Table 6.1 coal consumption is recalculated from 1992 forward to reflect the additional coal consumed by the other power producers.  All data in the Energy Consumption by Sector section  were recalculated for 1992 forward to reflect the incorporation of the additional coal.  All consumption-related data in the Overview section (Tables 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.9) also were recalculated for 1992 forward.

<h3>EIA Includes Biodiesel Production in Distillate Fuel Oil Demand Calculation</h3>

<p style="font-size:11px;margin:0px;padding:4px 0px;color:#7d7d7d;">
<strong>Released: August 30, 2012</strong></p>

U.S. and regional petroleum supply and disposition balances reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in the Petroleum Supply Monthly (PSM) included biodiesel production data for the first time in May 2012.  In addition, previously published PSM data for January-April 2012 were revised to include biodiesel production.  Similar revisions will be reported for 2011 when the Petroleum Supply Annual is released at the end of August 2012.  Biodiesel production data in the PSM allow EIA to more completely account for biodiesel when calculating demand (measured as product supplied) for distillate fuel oil.  Biodiesel production and other biodiesel data are included on the line called "Renewable Fuels Except Fuel Ethanol" in PSM supply and disposition tables.  See Appendix B "Detailed Statistics Explanatory Notes" for additional information and details.
